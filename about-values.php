        	<p>Slam Brands has not only managed to obtain a leadership role in the Ready-to-Assemble furniture segment but has done so while rigorously upholding a core set of values that are highly prized by its team members, customers and overseas manufactures. The Company has a widely held set of values that contribute to its success and positively impact all touch points internally and externally.</p>
			<p>These core values have enabled the Company to attract aggressive, like-minded team members that are not only interested in “winning” but in doing so with a focus on ethics. The Company is highly regarded as being fair and ethical by its customers, manufacturers and even competitors. Management firmly believes this core set of values has greatly contributed to its success and has won the “hearts” of its customers and subsequent trust.</p> 
			<p>The Company culture can be summarized in the following statements:</p>
			<p><em>Find, develop, and retain the best talent by creating a work environment based on mutual respect, logic-based decision making and a distinct absence of “bad behavior” amongst team members.</em></p>
			<p><em>Provide significant career opportunities based on team members’ individual merit and share in the upside of success at every level of the organization.</em></p>
			<p><em>Consider the “human” aspects of every decision and act with the highest degree of ethics and integrity.</p>
			<p><em>Respect team members, customers, and vendors with the inherent dignity we all deserve and seek to enhance every touch point with an honest and fair approach.</em></p>
			<p><em>Promote a healthy work-personal balance and seek to provide a positive foundation for team members to achieve self actualization in their personal lives.</em></p>
