With a passion for creative endeavors, he designed and funded the development of the Company’s first TV stand sample and initial national roll-out. His vision came to fruition in 2002 when Costco tested Slam Brands’ television stand in 30 stores. After generating positive consumer feedback and retail sales, the product was picked up as an in-line item in 2003 and sold over 12,000 units at Costco.</p>			<p>Leveraging the success of its relationship with Costco, Slam Brands aggressively built up its design, product development and sourcing capabilities throughout 2003 and 2004. The Company enhanced its product development strategy to focus on product lines and categories as opposed to individual products. Consequently, the Company was able to maintain and expand its presence in Costco while still offering exclusive product lines to new customers. From 2004 to 2006, the Company diversified its client base through new relationships with Circuit City and Target.</p>			<p>Capitalizing on the visibility and popularity of the gaming segment, Slam Brands introduced its first gaming furniture line in June of 2006. As the sole authorized supplier of licensed Xbox and Nintendo Wii furniture, the Company quickly secured gaming products at Walmart, Target, and Circuit City. Recognizing the opportunity to leverage the Company’s design talents and mass merchant relationships, the Company further expanded its product offering through the Savante case goods line of entertainment and office furniture in 2006.</p> 			<p>Slam Brands has established itself as a design and delivery leader within the industry. As a result of achievements in streamlining Company processes, customer expansion and the introduction of two new product categories, 2007 was a tremendous year for Slam Brands. In response to this success, the Company opened a representative office in China to improve product development, quality assurance and supply chain management proficiency and timelines.</p>			<p>So far, 2008 has brought continued success to our Company.  Both new and expanded relationships with the top CE retailers have given us the opportunity to offer an innovative and broad selection of entertainment furniture to the consumer. Slam Brands continues to look to the future with new and exciting offerings to meet the ever-changing requirements of new technologies and to exceed the expectations of the savvy, retail customer. This fall, we look forward to releasing new product into the market as we celebrate the sale of our 1,000,000th unit!</p>        </div>	</div>    <!-- END CONTENT --><?php include('includes/footer-main.php'); ?>
